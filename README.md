# Personal Transport API (Bike Rentals â€“ Sprint 1, Flask)

A lightweight REST API for a **Bike Rental** service.

**Sprint 1 goal:** rename, clean up, and ship a working MVP using **Flask** â€” fast, focused, and demo-ready.

> Why Flask first? Sprint 1 is about momentum, not perfection. Weâ€™ll migrate to FastAPI in a future sprint once the MVP is alive.

---

## Features (Sprint 1 scope)
- Basic **CRUD** for bikes and rentals (MVP endpoints)
- Clear repo workflow (Issues â†’ Branches â†’ PRs â†’ Merge)
- Strict branch naming with CI guardrail
- Project board: **To Do â†’ In Progress â†’ Done** (manual column moves)

**Planned (Sprint 2+)**
- Migrate to **FastAPI** (auto-docs, async)
- AuthN/AuthZ
- Payments integration
- Inventory/availability logic
- Test suite + CI

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python** 3.10+
- **Flask** (Sprint 1)
- **JSON REST**
- **GitHub** Projects + Actions

## Getting Started (Intern-Friendly)

> If this is your first rodeo, follow these steps exactly â€” then break stuff *intentionally* once it runs. ðŸ˜„

### 1) Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MelEUsher/PersonalTransportAPI.git
cd PersonalTransportAPI

### 2) Create & activate a virtual environment
macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

### 3) Install dependencies
If requirements.txt exists:
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4) Run the app (preferred)
python app.py

#### Alternative (flask run):
# macOS/Linux
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run --port 5000

# Windows (cmd)
set FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run --port 5000

# Windows (PowerShell)
$Env:FLASK_APP="app.py"
flask run --port 5000

Visit: http://localhost:5000

## Development Workflow (read this like a cheat sheet)
We keep it simple and professional.

### 1) Create an Issue
Every task starts as an Issue (use the Task template).
The Project board is your home base.
### 2) Create a branch from the Issue (strict naming)
feature/issue-<number>-short-name
bugfix/issue-<number>-short-name
chore/issue-<number>-short-name

#### Examples
feature/issue-12-rentals-endpoint
bugfix/issue-7-auth-timezone
chore/issue-3-rewrite-readme

####CLI
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout -b feature/issue-12-rentals-endpoint

### 3) Do the work, commit small, push
git add .
git commit -m "Issue #12: implement /rentals endpoints and basic validation"
git push -u origin feature/issue-12-rentals-endpoint

### 4) Open a PR (link the Issue)
In your PR description, add:
Closes #<issue-number>

GitHub auto-closes the Issue when the PR merges.

### 5) Get green checks, then submit PR.
`master` is protected: PR required, no direct pushes.

## Working With the Project Board
New Issues auto-add to the project (based on your workflow filter).
Move between To Do / In Progress / Done manually (expected in new GitHub Projects).
Status automation is optional; weâ€™re keeping it manual for simplicity.

## Testing (Placeholder -- testing will be added later)
####Expected (when added):
pytest -q
# or
make test

## Contributing
See CONTRIBUTING.md for branch naming, Issue â†’ Branch â†’ PR flow, and checklist.
